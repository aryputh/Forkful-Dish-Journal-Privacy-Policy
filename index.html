  <h1>Privacy Policy for Forkful: Dish Journal</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 19, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Forkful: Dish Journal</strong> (“the App”)
    handles your information. The App is developed and published by
    <strong>CodeLotl1001</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Forkful: Dish Journal is a personal food journaling app that allows you to record
    restaurants, dishes, ratings, photos, and your own notes. All data is stored
    <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not operate any servers for this app,
    and we do not collect, transmit, or sell your personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information that is transmitted
    to us or to third parties. All information you enter stays on your device.
  </p>

  <h3>Locally Stored Data</h3>
  <p>
    The App stores the following types of data locally on your device:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Restaurant details (e.g., name, location, notes)</li>
    <li>Dish details (e.g., name, associated restaurant, cuisine, rating, notes)</li>
    <li>Photos you choose to attach to restaurants or dishes</li>
    <li>App settings and preferences (e.g., theme, sorting options, display options)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is saved using on-device storage. It is not automatically backed up or
    synced by the App to any external service.
  </p>

  <h3>Photos</h3>
  <p>
    When you choose to attach a photo to a restaurant or dish, the App accesses your
    device’s photo library with your permission. The selected photos (or references
    to them) are stored only on your device and are used solely within the App to
    display your own entries. They are <strong>not</strong> uploaded or shared with us
    or any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> share any of your data with third parties. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics) are used.</li>
    <li>No advertising networks (e.g., AdMob) are integrated.</li>
    <li>No crash reporting or tracking SDKs are used.</li>
    <li>No external APIs or cloud services are used to send or store your data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Accounts and Authentication</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not require you to create an account or log in. We do not collect
    usernames, email addresses, passwords, or any other authentication information.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for general audiences and is not specifically targeted at
    children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
    from children. Because we do not collect or transmit data to our own servers,
    we have no way to identify or contact individual users.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information
    depends largely on the security of your device itself (such as using a device
    passcode or biometric lock). We recommend that you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a strong screen lock on your device.</li>
    <li>Keep your operating system up to date.</li>
    <li>Be cautious when sharing your device with others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you lose your device or it is compromised, the data stored in the App may be
    accessible to others who have access to your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Deletion and Control</h2>
  <p>
    You are in control of the data stored in the App. You can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete individual restaurants or dishes from within the App.</li>
    <li>Use the in-app option to delete all stored data.</li>
    <li>Uninstall the App from your device, which will typically remove all App data stored locally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>International Users</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not transfer your data across borders or to any servers. All data
    remains on your device, regardless of your country of residence or use.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update
    the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after
    any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
  </p>

    the App handles your information, you can contact us at:
